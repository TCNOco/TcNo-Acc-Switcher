GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 3, 29 June 2007

 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works.

  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have
certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive
or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they
know their rights.

  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and
authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
authors of previous versions.

  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of
protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic
pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to
use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we
have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those
products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we
stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions
of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.

  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that
patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS

  0. Definitions.

  "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

  "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
works, such as semiconductor masks.

  "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

  To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.

  A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
on the Program.

  To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
public, and in some countries other activities as well.

  To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

  An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"
to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.

  1. Source Code.

  The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source
form of a work.

  A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
is widely used among developers working in that language.

  The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
"Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.

  The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's
System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
includes interface definition files associated with source files for
the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
subprograms and other parts of the work.

  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
Source.

  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
same work.

  2. Basic Permissions.

  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.

  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works
for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.

  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
makes it unnecessary.

  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
measures.

  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's
users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of
technological measures.

  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
    it, and giving a relevant date.

    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
    released under this License and any conditions added under section
    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
    "keep intact all notices".

    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.

    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
    work need not make them do so.

  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work
in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
parts of the aggregate.

  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
in one of these ways:

    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
    customarily used for software interchange.

    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.

    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
    with subsection 6b.

    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to
    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the
    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.

    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
    charge under subsection 6d.

  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
included in conveying the object code work.

  A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any
tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular
product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a
typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product
is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
the only significant mode of use of the product.

  "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,
procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must
suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
modification has been made.

  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply
if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
been installed in ROM).

  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a
network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
protocols for communication across the network.

  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
source code form), and must require no special password or key for
unpacking, reading or copying.

  7. Additional Terms.

  "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
this License without regard to the additional permissions.

  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of
that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:

    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or

    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
    Notices displayed by works containing it; or

    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or

    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
    authors of the material; or

    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or

    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of
    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for
    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
    those licensors and authors.

  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further
restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you
received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
governed by this License along with a term that is a further
restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains
a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
not survive such relicensing or conveying.

  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
where to find the applicable terms.

  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
the above requirements apply either way.

  8. Termination.

  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
paragraph of section 11).

  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
prior to 60 days after the cessation.

  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
your receipt of the notice.

  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
material under section 10.

  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,
nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do
not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.

  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.

  An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered
work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could
give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.

  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may
not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.

  11. Patents.

  A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".

  A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims
owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For
purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant
patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
this License.

  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
propagate the contents of its contributor version.

  In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a
party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
patent against the party.

  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have
actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work
in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
country that you have reason to believe are valid.

  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
work and works based on it.

  A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within
the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered
work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is
in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment
to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.

  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.

  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.

  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a
covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey
the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.

  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single
combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this
License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,
section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the
combination as such.

  14. Revised Versions of this License.

  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General
Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the
option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered
version or of any later version published by the Free Software
Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the
GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published
by the Free Software Foundation.

  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's
public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you
to choose that version for the Program.

  Later license versions may give you additional or different
permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
later version.

  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.

  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  16. Limitation of Liability.

  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
SUCH DAMAGES.

  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.

  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
copy of the Program in return for a fee.

                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
    along with this program.  If not, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short
notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:

    <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands
might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an "about box".

  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,
if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.
For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see
<https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you
may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with
the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General
Public License instead of this License.  But first, please read
<https://www.gnu.org/licenses/why-not-lgpl.html>.

   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

   1. Definitions.

      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
      the copyright owner that is granting the License.

      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
      exercising permissions granted by this License.

      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
      replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
      the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
      comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
      file or class name and description of purpose be included on the

SIL OPEN FONT LICENSE Version 1.1 - 26 February 2007
-----------------------------------------------------------

PREAMBLE
The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide
development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation
efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and
open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership
with others.

The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and
redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The
fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded,
redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved
names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,
however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The
requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply
to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.

DEFINITIONS
"Font Software" refers to the set of files released by the Copyright
Holder(s) under this license and clearly marked as such. This may
include source files, build scripts and documentation.

"Reserved Font Name" refers to any names specified as such after the
copyright statement(s).

"Original Version" refers to the collection of Font Software components as
distributed by the Copyright Holder(s).

"Modified Version" refers to any derivative made by adding to, deleting,
or substituting -- in part or in whole -- any of the components of the
Original Version, by changing formats or by porting the Font Software to a
new environment.

"Author" refers to any designer, engineer, programmer, technical
writer or other person who contributed to the Font Software.

PERMISSION & CONDITIONS
Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining
a copy of the Font Software, to use, study, copy, merge, embed, modify,
redistribute, and sell modified and unmodified copies of the Font
Software, subject to the following conditions:

1) Neither the Font Software nor any of its individual components,
in Original or Modified Versions, may be sold by itself.

2) Original or Modified Versions of the Font Software may be bundled,
redistributed and/or sold with any software, provided that each copy
contains the above copyright notice and this license. These can be
included either as stand-alone text files, human-readable headers or
in the appropriate machine-readable metadata fields within text or
binary files as long as those fields can be easily viewed by the user.

3) No Modified Version of the Font Software may use the Reserved Font
Name(s) unless explicit written permission is granted by the corresponding
Copyright Holder. This restriction only applies to the primary font name as
presented to the users.

4) The name(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) or the Author(s) of the Font
Software shall not be used to promote, endorse or advertise any
Modified Version, except to acknowledge the contribution(s) of the
Copyright Holder(s) and the Author(s) or with their explicit written
permission.

5) The Font Software, modified or unmodified, in part or in whole,
must be distributed entirely under this license, and must not be
distributed under any other license. The requirement for fonts to
remain under this license does not apply to any document created
using the Font Software.

TERMINATION
This license becomes null and void if any of the above conditions are
not met.

 GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE


Version 2.1, February 1999

Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.

51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA

Everyone is per
mitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but
changing it is not allowed.

[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.
It also counts as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2,
hence the version number 2.1.]

Preamble

The licenses for most software are desig
ned to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU
General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.

This license,
 the Lesser General Public License, applies to some specially designated software
 packages--typically libraries--of the Free Software Foundation and other authors
 who decide to use it. You can use it too, but we suggest you first think
 carefully about whether this license or the ordinary General Public License is
 the better strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations
 below.


When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use, not price.
Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom
to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish);
that you receive source code or can get it if you want it; that you can change
the software and use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you are informed
that you can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid distributors
to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these rights. These
restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute
copies of the library or if you modify it.

For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a
fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave you. You must
make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. If you link
other code with the library, you must provide complete object files to the
recipients, so that they can relink them with the library after making changes
to the library and recompiling it. And you must show them these terms so they
know their rights.

We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the library,
and (2) we offer you  this license, which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the library.

To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that there is no
warranty for the free library. Also, if the library is modified by someone else
and passed on, the recipients should know that what they have is not the original
version, so that the original author's reputation will not be affected by
problems that might be introduced by others.

Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of any free
program. We wish to make sure that a company cannot effectively restrict the
users of a free program by obtaining a restrictive license from a patent holder.
Therefore, we insist that any patent license obtained for a version of the
library must be consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.

Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU
General Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser General Public License,
applies to certain designated libraries, and is quite different from the ordinary
General Public License. We use this license for certain libraries in order to
permit linking those libraries into non-free programs.

When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using a shared
library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a combined work, a
derivative of the original library. The ordinary General Public License therefore
permits such linking only if the entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.
The Lesser General Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other
code with the library.

We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it does Less
to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General Public License. It also
provides other free software developers Less of an advantage over competing
non-free programs. These disadvantages are the reason we use the ordinary
General Public License for many libraries. However, the Lesser license provides
advantages in certain special circumstances.

For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to encourage the
widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes a de-facto
standard. To achieve this, non-free programs must be allowed to use the library.
A more frequent case is that a free library does the same job as widely used
non-free libraries. In this case, there is little to gain by limiting the free
library to free software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.

In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free programs
enables a greater number of people to use a large body of free software. For
example, permission to use the GNU C Library in non-free programs enables
many more people to use the whole GNU operating system, as well as its variant,
the GNU/Linux operating system.

Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the users'
freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is linked with the
Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run that program using a modified
version of the Library.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification
follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a "work based on the
library" and a "work that uses the library". The former contains code derived
from the library, whereas the latter must be combined with the library in order
to run.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

   0.
This License Agreement applies to any software library or other program which
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party saying
it may be distributed under the terms of this Lesser General Public License (also
called "this License"). Each licensee is addressed as "you".

   A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared so
   as to be conveniently linked with application programs (which use some of
   those functions and data) to form executables.

   The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work which has
   been distributed under these terms. A "work based on the Library" means either
   the Library or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work
   containing the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with
   modifications and/or translated straightforwardly into another language.
   (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term
   "modification".)

   "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making
   modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means all the source
   ode for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition
   files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the
   library.

   Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered
   by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running a program
   using the Library is not restricted, and output from such a program is
   covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Library
   (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for writing it). Whether
   that is true depends on what the Library does and what the program that uses
   the Library does.

   1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete
   source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously
   and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and
   disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License
   and to the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License
   along with the Library.

   You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may
   at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

   2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it,
   thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such
   modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you
   also meet all of these conditions:


      a) The modified work must itself be a software library.

      b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating
      that you changed the files and the date of any change.

      c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to
      all third parties under the terms of this License.

      d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table
      of data to be supplied by an application program that uses the facility,
      other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked, then you
      must make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an application
      does not supply such function or table, the facility still operates, and
      performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful.

   (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose
   that is entirely well-defined independent of the application. Therefore,
   Subsection 2d requires that any application-supplied function or table used
   by this function must be optional: if the application does not supply it, the
   square root function must still compute square roots.)


   These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable
   sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and can be reasonably
   considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License,
   and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as
   separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole
   which is a work based on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be
   on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to
   the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

   Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your
   rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the
   right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on
   the Library.

   In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with
   the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a storage or
   distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this
   License.

   3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License
   instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do this, you must
   alter all the notices that refer to this License, so that they refer to the
   ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, instead of to this License.
   (If a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License
   has appeared, then you can specify that version instead if you wish.) Do not
   make any other change in these notices.

   Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy,
   so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all subsequent copies
   and derivative works made from that copy.

   This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the Library
   into a program that is not a library.

   4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it,
   under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections
   1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete corresponding
   machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of
   Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange.

   If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a
   designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from
   the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code, even
   though thirdparties are not compelled to copy the source along with the
   object code.

   5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but
   is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is
   called a "work that uses the Library". Such a work, in isolation, is not a
   derivative work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this
   License.

   However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library creates an
   executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains portions
   of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the library". The executable
   is therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for distribution
   of such executables.

   When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file that is
   part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a derivative work of
   the Library even though the source code is not. Whether this is true is
   especially significant if the work can be linked without the Library, or if the
   work is itself a library. The threshold for this to be true is not precisely
   defined by law.

   If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts
   and accessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten linesor less
   in length), then the use of the object file is unrestricted, regardless of
   whether it is legally a derivative work. (Executables containing this object
   code plus portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.)

   Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the
   object code for the work under the terms of Section 6. Any executables
   containing that work also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are linked
   directly with the Library itself.

   6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or link a "work
   that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a work containing portions
   of the Library, and distribute that work under terms of your choice, provided
   that the terms permit modification of the work for the customer's own use and
   reverse engineering for debugging such modifications.

   You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is
   used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License. You must
   supply a copy of this License. If the work during execution displays copyright
   notices, you must include the copyright notice for the Library among them, as
   well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this License. Also, you
   must do one of these things:

      a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable source
      code for the Library including whatever changes were used in the work (which
      must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an
      executable linked with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work
      what uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the user
      can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified executable
      containing the modified Library. (It is understood that the user who changes
      the contents of definitions files in the Library will not necessarily be
      able to recompile the application to use the modified definitions.)

      b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library.
      A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a copy of the library
      already present on the user's computer system, rather than copying library
      functions into the executable, and (2) will operate properly with a modified
      version of the library, if the user installs one, as long as the modified
      version is interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.

      c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three years,
      to give the same user the materials specified in Subsection 6a, above,
      for a charge no more than the cost of performing this distribution.

      d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a
      designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above specified
      materials from the same place.

      e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials
      or that you have already sent this user a copy.


   For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the Library" must
   include any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the executable
   from it. However, as a special exception, the materials to be distributed need
   not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
   form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating
   system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
   the executable.

   It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of
   other proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating system.
   Such a contradiction means you cannot use both them and the Library together
   in an executable that you distribute.

   7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library
   side-by-side in a single library together with other library facilities not
   covered by this License, and distribute such a combined library, provided that
   the separate distribution of the work based on the Library and of the other
   library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two
   things:

      a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the
      Library, uncombined with any other library facilities. This must be
      distributed under the terms of the Sections above.


      b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part
     of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the
     accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

   8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library
   except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy,
   modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library is void, and will
   automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who
   have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have
   their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

   9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.
   However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Library
   or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not
   accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or
   any work based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to
   do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
   the Library or works based on it.

   10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the Library),
   the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to
   copy, distribute, link withor modify the Library subject to these terms and
   conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients'
   exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing
   compliance by third parties with this License.

   11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
   infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
   conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise)
   that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from
   the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy
   simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent
   obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Library at all.
   For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution
   of the Library by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through
   you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
   refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.

   If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforce able under any
   particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply, and
   the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.


   It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or
   other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this
   section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software
   distribution system which is implemented by public license practices. Many
   people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
   through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is
   up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software
   through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.

   This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a
   consequence of the rest of this License.

   12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain
   countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright
   holder who places the Library under this License may add an explicit geographical
   distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is
   permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this
   License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

   13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the
   Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar
   in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems
   or concerns.

   Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library specifies
   a version number of this License which applies to it and "any later version",
   you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version
   or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the
   Library does not specify a license version number, you may choose any version
   ever published by the Free Software Foundation.


   14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free programs
   whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write to the author
   to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software
   Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions
   for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free
   status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and
   reuse of software generally.

   NO WARRANTY

   15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR
   THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE
   STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE
   LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,
   INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND
   FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND
   PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU
   ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

   16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL
   ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE
   LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL,
   SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY
   TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
   RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF
   THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER
   PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. END OF TERMS AND
   CONDITIONS

How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries

If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to
the public, we recommend making it free software that everyone can redistribute
and change. You can do so by permitting redistribution under these terms (or,
alternatively, underthe terms of the ordinary General Public License).

To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library. It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the
exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" line
and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

 < one line to give the library's name and an idea of what it does. >

Copyright (C) < year > < name of author >

This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under
the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License as published by the Free
Software Foundation; either version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option)
any later version.

This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY
WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR
A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU Lesser General Public License for more details.

You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public License along
with this library; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 51
Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA Also add information on
how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school,
if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if necessary. Here is
a sample; alter the names:

Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the library `Frob'
(a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.

That's all there is to it!

CREATIVE COMMONS CORPORATION IS NOT A LAW FIRM AND DOES NOT PROVIDE LEGAL
SERVICES. DISTRIBUTION OF THIS LICENSE DOES NOT CREATE AN ATTORNEY-CLIENT
RELATIONSHIP. CREATIVE COMMONS PROVIDES THIS INFORMATION ON AN "AS-IS" BASIS.
CREATIVE COMMONS MAKES NO WARRANTIES REGARDING THE INFORMATION PROVIDED, AND
DISCLAIMS LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES RESULTING FROM ITS USE.

License

THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE
COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE"). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY
COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS
AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED.

BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE
BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. TO THE EXTENT THIS LICENSE MAY BE
CONSIDERED TO BE A CONTRACT, THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE
IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.

1. Definitions

  a. "Adaptation" means a work based upon the Work, or upon the Work and
    other pre-existing works, such as a translation, adaptation, derivative
    work, arrangement of music or other alterations of a literary or artistic
    work, or phonogram or performance and includes cinematographic adaptations
    or any other form in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted
    including in any form recognizably derived from the original, except that a
    work that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation for
    the purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is
    a musical work, performance or phonogram, the synchronization of the Work
    in timed-relation with a moving image ("synching") will be considered an
    Adaptation for the purpose of this License.

  b. "Collection" means a collection of literary or artistic works, such as
    encyclopedias and anthologies, or performances, phonograms or broadcasts,
    or other works or subject matter other than works listed in Section 1(f)
    below, which, by reason of the selection and arrangement of their contents,
    constitute intellectual creations, in which the Work is included in its
    entirety in unmodified form along with one or more other contributions,
    each constituting separate and independent works in themselves, which
    together are assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a
    Collection will not be considered an Adaptation (as defined below) for the
    purposes of this License.

  c. "Creative Commons Compatible License" means a license that is listed at
    https://creativecommons.org/compatiblelicenses that has been approved by
    Creative Commons as being essentially equivalent to this License,
    including, at a minimum, because that license: (i) contains terms that have
    the same purpose, meaning and effect as the License Elements of this
    License; and, (ii) explicitly permits the relicensing of adaptations of
    works made available under that license under this License or a Creative
    Commons jurisdiction license with the same License Elements as this
    License.

  d. "Distribute" means to make available to the public the original and
    copies of the Work or Adaptation, as appropriate, through sale or other
    transfer of ownership.

  e. "License Elements" means the following high-level license attributes as
    selected by Licensor and indicated in the title of this License:
    Attribution, ShareAlike.

  f. "Licensor" means the individual, individuals, entity or entities that
    offer(s) the Work under the terms of this License.

  Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive,
  perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to
  exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:

  a. to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more
    Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collections;
  b. to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such Adaptation,
    including any translation in any medium, takes reasonable steps to clearly
    label, demarcate or otherwise identify that changes were made to the
    original Work. For example, a translation could be marked "The original
    work was translated from English to Spanish," or a modification could
    indicate "The original work has been modified.";
  c. to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated in
    Collections; and,
  e. to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.
  f. For the avoidance of doubt:
    i. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which
      the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory
      licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive

    ii. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which
      the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory
      licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives the exclusive right to
      collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under
      this License; and,
    iii. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor waives the right to collect
      royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is a
      member of a collecting society that administers voluntary licensing
      schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the rights granted
      under this License.

The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now
known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such
modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other
media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly
granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.

4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made
  subject to and limited by the following restrictions:

  a. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of
    this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource
    Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You
    Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on
    the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of the
    recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient
    under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must
    keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of
    warranties with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform.
    When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any
    effective technological measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a
    recipient of the Work /from You to exercise the rights granted to that
    recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the
    Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the
    Collection apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of
    this License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You
    must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit as
    required by Section 4(c), as requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon
    notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from
    the Adaptation any credit as required by Section 4(c), as requested.

  b. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation only under the
    terms of: (i) this License; (ii) a later version of this License with the
    same License Elements as this License; (iii) a Creative Commons
    jurisdiction license (either this or a later license version) that contains
    the same License Elements as this License (e.g., Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0
    US)); (iv) a Creative Commons Compatible License. If you license the
    Adaptation under one of the licenses mentioned in (iv), you must comply
    with the terms of that license. If you license the Adaptation under the
    terms of any of the licenses mentioned in (i), (ii) or (iii) (the
    "Applicable License"), you must comply with the terms of the Applicable
    License generally and the following provisions: (I) You must include a copy
    of, or the URI for, the Applicable License with every copy of each
    Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly Perform; (II) You may not offer or
    impose any terms on the Adaptation that restrict the terms of the
    Applicable License or the ability of the recipient of the Adaptation to
    exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the
    Applicable License; (III) You must keep intact all notices that refer to
    the Applicable License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy
    of the Work as included in the Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly
    Perform; (IV) when You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Adaptation, You
    may not impose any effective technological measures on the Adaptation that
    restrict the ability of a recipient of the Adaptation from You to exercise
    the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the Applicable
    License. This Section 4(b) applies to the Adaptation as incorporated in a
    Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the
    Adaptation itself to be made subject to the terms of the Applicable
    License.

  c. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or
    Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section
    4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable
    to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original
    Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original
    Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor
    institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution ("Attribution
    Parties") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other
    reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the
    Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if
    any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such
    URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the
    Work; and (iv) , consistent with Ssection 3(b), in the case of an
    Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (
    e.g., "French translation of the Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay
    based on original Work by Original Author"). The credit required by this
    Section 4(c) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided,
    however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such
    credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the
    Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these credits and in a
    manner at least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing
    authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required
    by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above
    and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly
    or explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or
    endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as
    appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express
    prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or
    Attribution Parties.

  d. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be
    otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or
    Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any Adaptations or
    Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other
    derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to the
    Original Author's honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those
    jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the right granted in
    Section 3(b) of this License (the right to make Adaptations) would be
    deemed to be a distortion, mutilation, modification or other derogatory
    action prejudicial to the Original Author's honor and reputation, the
    Licensor will waive or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the
    fullest extent permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You to
    reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License (right to
    make Adaptations) but not otherwise.


5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer

UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS
THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND
CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING,
WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,
ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE.
SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH
EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN
  NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL,
  INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS
  LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
  POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. Termination

  a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically
    upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities
    who have received Adaptations or Collections from You under this License,
    however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or
    entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7,
    and 8 will survive any termination of this License.

  b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is
    perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work).
    Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work
    under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time;
    provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this
    License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted
    under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force
    and effect unless terminated as stated above.


8. Miscellaneous

  a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection,
    the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same
    terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.

  b. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor
    offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms
    and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.

  c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under
    applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the
    remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the
    parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum
    extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.

  d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no
    breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and
    signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.

  e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with
    respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements
    or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor
    shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any
    communication from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual
    written agreement of the Licensor and You.

  f. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this
    License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention for
    the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on September 28,
    1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the
    WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright
    Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter
    take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are
    sought to be enforced according to the corresponding provisions of the
    implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable national law.
    If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law
    includes additional rights not granted under this License, such additional
    rights are deemed to be included in the License; this License is not
    intended to restrict the license of any rights under applicable law.

          Agreement, currently available at: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-
          us/library/windows/apps/hh694058.aspx.
        ii.	Bing Maps. The software may include
          features that retrieve content such as maps, images and other data through the
          Bing Maps (or successor branded) application programming interface (the “Bing
          Maps API”) to create reports displaying data on top of maps, aerial and hybrid
          imagery. If these features are included, you may use these features to create
          and view dynamic or static documents only in conjunction with and through
          methods and means of access integrated in the software. You may not otherwise
          copy, store, archive, or create a database of the entity information including
          business names, addresses and geocodes available through the Bing Maps API. You
          may not use the Bing Maps API to provide sensor based guidance/routing, nor use
          any Road Traffic Data or Bird’s Eye Imager (or associated metadata) even if
          available through the Bing Maps API for any purpose. Your use of the Bing Maps

          to Microsoft and/or third party providers based on the use or volume of use of
          such Additional Mapping APIs. These terms and conditions will be provided when
          you obtain any necessary license keys to use such Additional Mapping APIs or
          when you review or receive documentation related to the use of such Additional
          Mapping APIs.iv.	Push Notifications. The Microsoft Push Notification Service
          may not be used to send notifications that are mission critical or otherwise
          could affect matters of life or death, including without limitation critical
          notifications related to a medical device or condition. MICROSOFT EXPRESSLY
          DISCLAIMS ANY WARRANTIES THAT THE USE OF THE MICROSOFT PUSH NOTIFICATION
          SERVICE OR DELIVERY OF MICROSOFT PUSH NOTIFICATION SERVICE NOTIFICATIONS WILL
          BE UNINTERRUPTED, ERROR FREE, OR OTHERWISE GUARANTEED TO OCCUR ON A REAL-TIME
          BASIS.v.	Speech namespace API. Using speech recognition functionality via the
          Speech namespace APIs in a program requires the support of a speech recognition
          service. The service may require network connectivity at the time of
          recognition (e.g., when using a predefined grammar). In addition, the service
          may also collect speech-related data in order to provide and improve the
          service. The speech-related data may include, for example, information related
          to grammar size and string phrases in a grammar.	Also, in order for a user to
          use speech recognition on the phone they must first accept certain terms of
          use. The terms of use notify the user that data related to their use of the
          speech recognition service will be collected and used to provide and improve
          the service. If a user does not accept the terms of use and speech recognition
          is attempted by the application, the operation will not work and an error will
          be returned to the application.
        vi.	PlayReady Support. The software may include
          the Windows Emulator, which contains Microsoft’s PlayReady content access
          technology.  Content owners use Microsoft PlayReady content access technology
          to protect their intellectual property, including copyrighted content.  This
          software uses PlayReady technology to access PlayReady-protected content and/or
          WMDRM-protected content.  Microsoft may decide to revoke the software’s ability
          to consume PlayReady-protected content for reasons including but not limited
          to (i) if a breach or potential breach of PlayReady technology occurs, (ii)
          proactive robustness enhancement, and (iii) if Content owners require the
          revocation because the software fails to properly enforce restrictions on
          content usage.  Revocation should not affect unprotected content or content
          protected by other content access technologies.  Content owners may require you
          to upgrade PlayReady to access their content.  If you decline an upgrade, you
          will not be able to access content that requires the upgrade and may not be
          able to install other operating system updates or upgrades.
        vii.	Package
          Managers. The software may include package managers, like NuGet, that give you
          the option to download other Microsoft and third party software packages to use
          with your application. Those packages are under their own licenses, and not
          this agreement. Microsoft does not distribute, license or provide any
          warranties for any of the third party packages.
          viii.	Font Components. While the
          software is running, you may use its fonts to display and print content. You
          may only embed fonts in content as permitted by the embedding restrictions in
          the fonts; and temporarily download them to a printer or other output device to
          help print content.
        ix.	Notice about the H.264/AVD Visual Standard, and the VC-
          1 Video Standard. This software may include H.264/MPEG-4 AVC and/or VD-1
          decoding technology. MPEG LA, L.L.C. requires this notice:
            THIS PRODUCT IS LICENSED UNDER THE AVC AND THE VC-1 PATENT PORTFOLIO LICENSES
            FOR THE PERSONAL AND NON-COMMERCIAL USE OF A CONSUMER TO (i) ENCODE VIDEO IN
            COMPLIANCE WITH THE ABOVE STANDARDS (“VIDEO STANDARDS”) AND/OR (ii) DECODE AVC,
            AND VC-1 VIDEO THAT WAS ENCODED BY A CONSUMER ENGAGED IN A PERSONAL AND
            NON-COMMERCIAL ACTIVITY AND/OR WAS OBTAINED FROM A VIDEO PROVIDER LICENSED
            TO PROVIDE SUCH VIDEO. NONE OF THE LICENSES EXTEND TO ANY OTHER PRODUCT
            REGARDLESS OF WHETHER SUCH PRODUCT IS INCLUDED WITH THIS SOFTWARE IN A SINGLE
            ARTICLE. NO LICENSE IS GRANTED OR SHALL BE IMPLIED FOR ANY OTHER USE.
            ADDITIONAL INFORMATION MAY BE OBTAINED FROM MPEG LA, L.L.C. SEE WWW.MPEGLA.COM.

            For clarification purposes, this notice does
            not limit or inhibit the use of the software for normal business uses that are
            personal to that business which do not include (i) redistribution of the
            software to third parties, or (ii) creation of content with the VIDEO STANDARDS
            compliant technologies for distribution to third parties.

3.	INTERNET-BASED SERVICES. Microsoft provides Internet-based services with the software.
It may change or cancel them at any time.
    a.	Consent for Internet-Based Services. The
      software features described below and in the privacy statement at http:
      //go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=521839 connect to Microsoft or service
      provider computer systems over the Internet. In some cases, you will not
      receive a separate notice when they connect. In some cases, you may switch off
      these features or not use them as described in the applicable product
      documentation. By using these features, you consent to the transmission of this
      information. Microsoft does not use the information to identify or contact
      you.
        i.	Computer Information. The following features use Internet protocols,
          which send to the appropriate systems computer information, such as your
          Internet protocol address, the type of operating system, browser, and name and
          version of the software you are using, and the language code of the device
          where you installed the software. Microsoft uses this information to make the
          Internet-based services available to you.
            •	Software Use and Performance.  This
              software collects info about your hardware and how you use the software and
              automatically sends error reports to Microsoft.  These reports include
              information about problems that occur in the software.  Reports might
              unintentionally contain personal information. For example, a report that
              contains a snapshot of computer memory might include your name. Part of a
              document you were working on could be included as well, but this information in
              reports or any info collected about hardware or your software use will not be
              used to identify or contact you.
            •	Digital Certificates. The software uses
              digital certificates. These digital certificates confirm the identity of
              Internet users sending X.509 standard encryption information. They also can be
              used to digitally sign files and macros to verify the integrity and origin of
              the file contents. The software retrieves certificates and updates certificate
              revocation lists using the Internet, when available.
            •	Windows Application
              Certification Kit. To ensure you have the latest certification tests, when
              launched this software periodically checks a Windows Application Certification
              Kit file on download.microsft.com to see if an update is available.  If an
              update is found, you are prompted and provided a link to a web site where you
              can download the update. You may use the Windows Application Certification Kit
              solely to test your programs before you submit them for a potential Microsoft
              Windows Certification and for inclusion on the Microsoft Windows Store. The
              results you receive are for informational purposes only. Microsoft has no
              obligation to either (i) provide you with a Windows Certification for your
              programs and/or ii) include your program in the Microsoft Windows Store.  •
              Microsoft Digital Rights Management for Silverlight. If you use Silverlight to
              access content that has been protected with Microsoft Digital Rights
              Management (DRM), in order to let you play the content, the software may
              automatically
            •	request media usage rights from a rights server on the Internet and
            •	download and install available DRM Updates.For more information about this
              feature, including instructions for turning the Automatic Updates off, go to
              http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=147032.
            •	Web Content Features.  Features
              in the software can retrieve related content from Microsoft and provide it to
              you. To provide the content, these features send to Microsoft the type of
              operating system, name and version of the software you are using, type of
              browser and language code of the device where you installed the software.
              Examples of these features are clip art, templates, online training, online
              assistance, help and Appshelp. You may choose not to use these web content
              features.
        ii.	Use of Information. We may use  nformation collected about
          software use and performance to provide and improve Microsoft software and
          services as further described in Microsoft’s Privacy Statement available at:
          https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=521839. We may also share it with
          others, such as hardware and software vendors. They may use the information to
          improve how their products run with Microsoft software.
        iii.	Misuse of Internet-
          based Services. You may not use these services in any way that could harm them
          or impair anyone else’s use of them. You may not use the services to try to
          gain unauthorized access to any service, data, account or network by any means.

4.	YOUR COMPLIANCE WITH PRIVACY AND DATA PROTECTION LAWS.
    a.	Personal
      Information Definition. "Personal Information" means any information relating
      to an identified or identifiable natural person; an identifiable natural person
      is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by
      reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location
      data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical,
      physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that
      natural person.
    b.	Collecting Personal Information using Packaged and Add-on
      APIs.  If you use any API to collect personal information from the software,
      you must comply with all laws and regulations applicable to your use of the
      data accessed through APIs including without limitation laws related to
      privacy, biometric data, data protection, and confidentiality of
      communications. Your use of the software is conditioned upon implementing and
      maintaining appropriate protections and measures for your applications and
      services, and that includes your responsibility to the data obtained through
      the use of APIs. For the data you obtained through any APIs, you must:
        i.
          obtain all necessary consents before collecting and using data and only use the
          data for the limited purposes to which the user consented, including any
          consent to changes in use;
        ii.	In the event you’re storing data, ensure that
          data is kept up to date and implement corrections, restrictions to data, or the
          deletion of data as updated through packaged or add-on APIs or upon user
          request if required by applicable law;
        iii.	implement proper retention and
          deletion policies, including deleting all data when as directed by your users
          or as required by applicable law; andiv.	maintain and comply with a written
          statement available to your customers that describes your privacy practices
          regarding data and information you collect, use and that you share with any
          third parties.
    c.	Location Framework. The software may contain a location
      framework component or APIs that enable support of location services in
      programs.  Programs that receive device location must comply with the
      requirements related to the Location Service APIs as described in the Microsoft
      Store Policies (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/legal/windows/agreements/store-
      policies).   If you choose to collect device location data outside of the
      control of Windows system settings, you must obtain legally sufficient consent
      for your data practices, and such practices must comply with all other
      applicable laws and regulations.
    d.	Security.  If your application or service
      collects, stores or transmits personal information, it must do so securely, by
      using modern cryptography methods.

5.	BACKUP COPY. You may make one backup copy of the software. You may use it only
  to reinstall the software.

6. DOCUMENTATION. Any person that has valid access to your computer or internal
  network may copy and use the documentation for your internal, reference
  purposes.

  updates, Internet-based services and support services that you use, are the
  entire agreement for the software and support services.

11.	INDEPENDENT
  PARTIES.  Microsoft and you are independent contractors. Nothing in this
  agreement shall be construed as creating an employer-employee relationship,
  processor-subprocessor relationship, a partnership, or a joint venture between
  the parties.

12.	APPLICABLE LAW AND PLACE TO RESOLVE DISPUTES. If you acquired
  the software in the United States or Canada, the laws of the state or province
  where you live (or, if a business, where your principal place of business is
  located) govern the interpretation of this agreement, claims for its breach,
  and all other claims (including consumer protection, unfair competition, and
  tort claims), regardless of conflict of laws principles. If you acquired the
  software in any other country, its laws apply. If U.S. federal jurisdiction
  exists, you and Microsoft consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the
  federal court in King County, Washington for all disputes heard in court. If
  not, you and Microsoft consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the
  Superior Court of King County, Washington for all disputes heard in court.

13. LEGAL EFFECT. This agreement describes certain legal rights. You may have other
  rights under the laws of your country. You may also have rights with respect to

      the software, services, content (including code) on third party Internet sites,
      or third party programs; and
    •	claims for breach of contract, breach of warranty, guarantee or condition,
    strict liability, negligence, or other tort to the extent permitted by applicable law.
  It also applies even if Microsoft knew or should have known about the possibility
  of the damages. The above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you because
  your country may not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental, consequential
  or other damages.
