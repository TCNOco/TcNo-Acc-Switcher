**A Superfast open-source account switcher for Steam, Battle.net, Epic Games, Origin, Riot Games, Ubisoft, and more**.
							     
**Saves NO passwords** or any user information*. Most switchers, including Steam work purely off changing a file and a few registry keys.
*Wastes no time closing, switching and restarting Steam and other platforms.*<br />
**NOTE:** Not created for cheating purposes. All it does is change accounts. Use it as you see it, accepting responsibility.

# How does it work?
Simple. It swaps out files and registry values, pointing to your last logged in account while the program is closed. Think of it as freezing a platform like Steam in time, and replacing the "account block" with a previously frozen "account block", then unfreezing it. To Steam and your Steam account, it "looks" like you pulled your plug out and put it back in a week or so later, meanwhile you were playing on other accounts. Swapping the account block lets the program: Not interact with passwords, and not interact with 2-factor, so you can "Skip" both of those in the login process.

## Consider supporting

This project is a massive time sink. For something completely open-source and free, I find myself with little time to develop. Consider supporting development on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/TroubleChute) or [Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/tcnoco).

## Where I've been
I was pursuing a complete overhaul of this software, but due to Micrisoft not fixing a breaking bug with drag and drop everything has halted. (https://github.com/TCNOco/TcNo-Acc-Switcher/tree/JsToRazor-DI-MAUI). In the meanwhile I've been putting off this project, but now am back to continuing incremental development here.

# What's new

Version 5.0 is released (Jan 2022)! Please report any and all bugs, as well as steps to recreate them into the Issues section, or the `#bug-report` channel under `TCNO ACCOUNT SWITCHER` section on the [Community Discord](https://s.tcno.co/AccSwitcherDiscord).

The new version adds the ability to easily create and maintain platforms by editing a simple text file `Platforms.json`. If you'd like to learn more, see this [Wiki page](https://github.com/TCNOco/TcNo-Acc-Switcher/wiki/Help-code-a-platform).

**Featuring**
-  **Better UI**, with animations. Fully user/community customisable **theme system**. 2 Themes built in (so far).
-   **Streamer mode** to hide SteamIDs and more while Stream software is running (ie OBS, XSplit...)
-   **Automatic updates** WAY smaller updates, due to using a new Patch system. No more redownloading the entire app. Only a few KB/MB at a time.
-  **Steam: Log in as Invisible, Offline and more!** Copy profile links, SteamID and create quick-switch desktop shortcuts!
- **Easily add new platforms** since version 5.0 (Jan 2022).

\[For info on how any of these work, see the [Wiki](https://github.com/TCNOco/TcNo-Acc-Switcher/wiki)]


## Required runtimes:
**If you use the installer:** The required runtimes will automatically be downloaded and installed.
**If you are NOT using the installer:** Run `_FIRST_RUN.exe` on a computer to bring up the same window as in the installer, where runtimes are downloaded and installed.
**For manual runtime download and install**, see the [Wiki on this GitHub](https://github.com/TCNOco/TcNo-Acc-Switcher/wiki#1-installing-required-runtimes)

### Visit the [Wiki](https://github.com/TCNOco/TcNo-Acc-Switcher/wiki) for more info and steps for your first launch.

	    <img alt="Website" src="https://i.imgur.com/izr2mKn.png" target="_blank" height=300">
	</a>
</p>
    
1. Download `TcNo.Account.Switcher.Installer...exe`
2. Run the installer, and the application should launch when done. If not:
Head into the folder where you installed the program and run `_FIRST_RUN.exe` to make sure required runtimes are installed, and then run `TcNo-Acc-Switcher.exe` to run the main program. The second is what shortcuts to the program should point to.

**For a portable installation (eg. on a USB) see [THIS](https://github.com/TCNOco/TcNo-Acc-Switcher/wiki#portable-eg-for-usb)** for steps on using the `.zip` or `.7z` below.
